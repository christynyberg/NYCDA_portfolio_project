    <h1>Code & Design</h1>
    <p>
    <h4>By: Christy Nyberg</h4>

<div class="block-element2">
    <p>In 1994, my first year of college, I started studying graphic design at the University of Florida. It was the first year email had been introduced on campus and, frankly, the idea of it intimidated me. To set the stage, email was relatively inaccessible. If you wanted to check email, you had to go to a computer lab or library to login and the mechanics of it were largely a mystery to me...nevermind that spam filters weren't commonplace and security was looming concern.
    </p>
    <p>One of the primary requirements for the graphic design program was to buy a Macintosh. Mine was a hulking desktop (as were most) and I loved it. Photoshop was something like version 2</a> and I distinctly remember the release that included "undo" and that multiple undo wasn't released until the year I graduated.</p>
    <p>Now that I've dated myself, I'll say that the next years were full of learning about design and passively engaging with web development. When I got my first "real job" in New York, it was at an interactive web agency that had segmented skills (IA, design, programming). This meant that I worked with programmers but continued to postpone learning the skills myself.</p>

<div class="block-element">
   <p>However, with each interaction I know there is much more under the hood that I would like to understand. Hence, NYCDA and WebDev100!
  </p>
</div>

<div class="block-element2">
  <p>Years have passed since then and I've enjoyed so much of design, even dipping into digital using platforms like WordPress, Shopify and Squarespace. So far, I've been pleasantly surprised at how much HTML and CSS look familiar to me and equally dismayed at how many details I've seen before but never really <em>seen</em>. Hopefully with practice, the broad strokes will develop finer points and I'll actually get good at this.
